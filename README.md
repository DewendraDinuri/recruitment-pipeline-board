# recruitment-pipeline-board
A Kanban-style recruitment pipeline built with React and Node.js for managing candidate applications through different hiring stages.



This project is a full-stack recruitment management tool that visualizes candidate progress through a hiring pipeline using a Kanban-style interface. The frontend is built with React (without Tailwind), and the backend is powered by Node.js with Express. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete candidate data, filter by stage, and interact with candidate cards — all using mock data or a real database. Recruitment Pipeline Board   This is a full-stack recruitment pipeline board that visualizes and manages candidates through different hiring stages using a Kanban layout.
